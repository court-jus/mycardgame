<title>Unnamed card game</title>

<h1>Yet Unnamed card game</h1>
<p>Ok, welcome here. My objective is to write a "collectible" card game that will be playable in a web browser. You are free to <a href="mailto:ghislain.leveque@gmail.com">contribute</a> if you want.</p>
<p>The game will remain free to play and opensource. When I say free to play, I mean it, no Premium account, no "get this special item if you pay" or this king of stuff.</p>
<p>Every player will be able to submit a new card. There will be a poll to choose if this card is interesting and must be added to the game or not.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p><b>Rules are Work In Progress. In case you didn't understand, I'm open to <a href="mailto:ghislain.leveque@gmail.com">contributions</a>.</b></p>
<p>This is a turn based strategy game for two players (maybe more later, why not...). The goal of the game is to acquire Victory Points.</p>
<p>The first player to reach NNN VP wins the match.</p>
<h3>Victory Points</h3>
<p>They are many ways to gain VP :
<dl>
<dt>Kill the other player</dt>
<dd>This can only be done when you miss one VP to win. Otherwise, the other player cannot be killed (revival rule still to be defined).</dd>
<dt>Build some special buildings</dt>
<dd>Some buildings give VP.</dd>
<dt>Ask the gods ?</dt>
<dd>Some miracle can happen... maybe</dd>
<dt>Kill some specific creatures</dt>
<dd>Some creatures are so powerful that you win a VP if you manage to kill one</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h3>Cards</h3>
<p>Each player has a deck with a minimum of NNN and a maximum of NNN cards. One card can be present NNN times in a deck.</p>
<p>There are five types of cards:
<dl>
<dt>Buildings</dt>
<dd>Buildings stay on the table until they are destroyed by being attacked or by some special cards. They can be upgraded. Some building cost ressource to maintain.</dd>
<dt>Creatures</dt>
<dd>Creatures are your minions, they also stay on the table. Use them to attack the other player's creatures, building or even the other player directly.</dd>
<dt>Events</dt>
<dd>Events are special cards that can only be played within certain circumstances. They affect both players and can be benefic or not...</dd>
<dt>Spells</dt>
<dd>Spells don't stay in play, they take action when played and discarded after.</dd>
<dt>Context</dt>
<dd>Context cards alter the game for both players and stay on the table until they are replaced by another context card of the same type or removed by special cards.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>You can see some card examples <a href="/table?reset=true">here</a> within the WIP GUI (roll over the cards to see them bigger). Feel free to contribute some if you want, this is just a brainstorm for now.</p>
<h3>Ressources</h3>
<p>To be able to play cards, the player has to pay ressources. There are five ressources : Gold, Blood, Wood, Alcohol and Mana.</p>
<p>Ressources are provided by Factories. Each factory produces one type of ressource and can be upgraded by some cards.</p>
<h3>Creatures</h3>
<p>Creatures have 4 caracteristics : 
<dl>
<dt>HP</dt>
<dd>Health Point. When this is zero, the creatures dies and goes to the cemetarry.</dd>
<dt>ATT</dt>
<dd>Attack skill. This denotates this creature skill at attacking, the higher the best.</dd>
<dt>DEF</dt>
<dd>Defense skill. This denotates this creature skill at defending itself, the higher the best.</dd>
<dt>DAM</dt>
<dd>Damage points. How many damage this creature deals when it succesfuly attacks.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>This is one of the original points of this game : cards are altered by the context. For example, vampires don't like the sunlight. This is not a legend. Another example : in the prehistoric times, animals were bigger (you think you can handle this vulture with your Thompson machinegun. But what about a Pteranodon when the gun powder didn't exist yet ????)</p>
<p>When a context card is in play, it affects some of the other cards (creatures, buildings, spells...). It can be changed by another context card of the same type or removed with some special cards.</p>
